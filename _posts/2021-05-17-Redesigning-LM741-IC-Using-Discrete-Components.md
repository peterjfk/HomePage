title: Redesigning the LM741-OP AMP using discrete components

# Motivation

I have a bunch of BJTs and MOSFET transistors lying around in my special drawer. I thought it would be cool if I could assemble these components to remake the all-popular LM741 integrated operation amplifier in a breadboard. The catch will 
be that I explain all the circuit theory that is used to describe the functionality of each and every block. This is an excellent exercise, in my view, that would 
force me to master the theoretical knowledge, and the practical design considerations. It also emphasizes simulation in LtSpice and sometimes in MATLAB.
