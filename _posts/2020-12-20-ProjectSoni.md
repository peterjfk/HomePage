title: Communication Link using Sound Waves
---
# Motivation
> About a year ago, the PC I owed from highschool crashed: it would turn on but neither the WiFi, bluetooth, Ethernet or USB ports worked. As this was near the end of the semester the situation was very dire so I used ended up buying another PC when my search for possible fixes ended. Fast forward a year latter, I realized that even without wires or fancy radio frequency tranceivers, point to point communication is still possible. Best example is how humans communicate by making sounds in the audible frequency range. Having had Audacity, a fairly advanced sound recording software on the old PC, a text editor, and a working c/c++ compiler, I was lucky. I could use my new PC to create and play a sound file containing some information and record it over on my old PC . I would then save the sound file in some format, and apply some signal processing concepts to recover the encoded information.
